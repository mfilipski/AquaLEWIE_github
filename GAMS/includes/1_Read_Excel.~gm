* This part of the code just reads in the data from the excel spreadsheet
* and makes it into a set of parameters to be used in the model  

* Name the sets that will be used:
sets
ac all accounts
g(ac) goods
f(ac) factors
h(ac) households
var  variable names
;
parameter Alldata(*,*,*,*,h);

* Read in the data from LEWIE spreadsheet:
* the $call reads XL data and makes a .gdx file with it
* (unstar the "call" statement to re-read from the excel spreadsheet)
$call "gdxxrw input=%data_input%.xlsx output=%data_input%.gdx index=%input_sheet_index%"
* The "Index" tab of the XL spreadsheet tells the gdxxrw procedure where things are.
* The index looks like this:

*Type        Name        Range        Dimensions
*                                        rdim       cdim
*dset        ac        Input!A3            1
*dset        var       Input!B3           1
*dset        h         Input!F2                       1
*dset        g         Input!C3             1
*dset        f         Input!E3:E300        1
*par         alldata   Input!B2        4         1

* Which means, for instance, that the column going down from cell "INPUT!a3" contains the set ac
* ac are all the accounts of the SAM, so you need to make sure this column contains all of those.
* similarly, column "Input!C3" is where GAMS reads the names of all the goods - so you need to make sure all are there
* etc. for all these elements.

* the $gdxin opens the data loading procedure and calls the .gdx file we just made
$gdxin %data_input%.gdx
$load AC G F H VAR ALLDATA
display ac, g, f, h, var, ALLDATA ;

* This option controls the decimals and display format
option alldata:2:4:1;
display alldata;

* the phantom element "null" can be put in a set to avoid leaving the set empty in some simulations
* (GAMS can't handle empty sets)
$phantom null

* Read in the matrix:

      (h,hh)
      (f,fa) ;
