* This unloads the parameter into a .gdx data file:
execute_unload "outmat.gdx" outmat ;
* And this writes in an excel sheet called "MakeMeASam":
execute "xlstalk.exe -s   MakeMeASam.xlsx" ;
execute "gdxxrw.exe outmat.gdx par=outmat o=MakeMeASam.xlsx rng=a1:aq43 rdim=3 cdim=3" ;
execute 'xlstalk.exe -O MakeMeASam.xlsx' ;

* NB: the range is important here rng=a1:am39 is the exact size of the Lesotho matrix
* this is to prevent the gdxxrw procedure from overwriting everything on the entire xl spreadsheet
* The first time you run the program, erase rng=a1:am39,
* then the program will put the SAM in cell a1, and from then you'll know how big your range needs to be.
